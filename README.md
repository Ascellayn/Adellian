# TBD_Name
[FiNAL NAME TO BE DETERMINED], Linux the Ascellayn way. Performance and efficiency over ease of use.

This is a collection of Shell scripts destined to quickly set-up a Debian SID Computer, whenever it's for daily drivers, as a secondary machine, or a server oriented environement.

## This collection of scripts is VERY personal
I won't care if you think this is an outragiously stupid way to use Linux. This is how I do it. If you're not happy, use Ubuntu or do the same shit this repository does but your way with Debian SID or Arch Linux.
### Use these scripts at your risk!
As I don't intend this to be a fully fledged, ready to ship OS, obviously a lot of things aren't user friendly. Hell, these scripts might actually fuck everything up. Don't say I didn't warn you.

**I WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT WITH THIS. FEEL FREE TO COMPLAIN AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. THIS MAY ALSO RANDOMLY STAY OUTDATED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.**

# DO NOT USE THESE SCRIPTS ON ANY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM BUT A CLEAN DEBIAN UNSTABLE/SID INSTALL
These scripts COULD work on other distributions but I wouldn't recommend it.
