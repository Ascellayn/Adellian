### Linux the Ascellayn way. A set of scripts to set up a Debian SID/Experimental environement that prioritizes performance and minimalism.  
This is a collection of Shell scripts destined to quickly set-up a Debian SID/Experimental Computer, whenever it's for daily driving, as a secondary machine, or a server oriented environment.

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> ### **Adellian is designed exclusively for Debian Experimental.**
> Running these scripts outside of a brand new fresh installation of **SPECIFICALLY DEBIAN UNSTABLE/SID** is beyond discouraged.  
> You may get a [Debian SID ISO here](https://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/amd64/daily/netboot/), just make sure to select "SID" when prompted for which Debian Branch to install and make sure to **deselect ALL additional software** when prompted.  
> We recommend also for minimalism's sake to select the "Targeted" option when prompted about drivers.
